## üìà Usage Examples

### Loading and Exploring the Dataset

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import plotly.express as ex

# Set visualization style
plt.style.use('dark_background')

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('data-1.csv')

# Display basic information
data.head()
data.info()
data.describe()
```

### Visualizing Player Distributions

```python
# Plot distribution of player ages
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.histplot(data['Age'], bins=20, kde=True)
plt.title('Distribution of Player Ages', fontsize=16)
plt.xlabel('Age', fontsize=12)
plt.ylabel('Count', fontsize=12)
plt.grid(alpha=0.3)
plt.show()

# Compare overall ratings by position
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
sns.boxplot(x='Position', y='Overall', data=data)
plt.title('Overall Ratings by Position', fontsize=16)
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
plt.grid(alpha=0.3)
plt.show()
```

### Analyzing Top Players

```python
# Display top 10 players by overall rating
top_players = data.sort_values('Overall', ascending=False).head(10)
top_players[['Name', 'Age', 'Nationality', 'Club', 'Overall', 'Potential']]

# Create a bar chart of top players
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
ax = sns.barplot(x='Name', y='Overall', data=top_players, palette='viridis')
plt.title('Top 10 Players by Overall Rating', fontsize=16)
plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right')
plt.tight_layout()

# Add value labels on top of bars
for i, v in enumerate(top_players['Overall']):
    ax.text(i, v+0.5, str(v), ha='center', fontsize=10)

plt.show()
```


## üìù Analysis Workflow

The analysis follows a structured approach to extract meaningful insights from the FIFA 2019 player dataset. Initially, we load and explore the data to understand its structure, checking for missing values and examining the distribution of key variables. This exploration phase is crucial for identifying potential issues and opportunities in the dataset.

Next, we clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and converting data types as needed. This ensures that our analysis is based on accurate and consistent information. With clean data in hand, we proceed to exploratory data analysis, investigating relationships between variables and identifying patterns through statistical methods and visualizations.

We then conduct feature-specific analysis, examining player attributes, positions, and clubs in detail to uncover interesting trends and comparisons. This targeted approach allows us to focus on specific aspects of player performance and characteristics. Finally, we interpret the results, drawing conclusions from our analysis and presenting findings in a clear, visual manner that makes complex data accessible and actionable.

## üîç Key Insights

Through this analysis, we uncover several fascinating insights about FIFA 2019 players. The distribution of player attributes across different positions reveals how certain skills are prioritized based on playing roles. For example, strikers typically have higher finishing and shooting attributes, while defenders excel in tackling and marking.

We also explore the correlation between player age, potential, and overall rating, showing how performance typically peaks at certain ages and declines thereafter. The comparison of player values across different leagues and nationalities highlights interesting economic patterns in the football market, with some leagues commanding premium valuations.

The analysis identifies undervalued players with high potential, providing valuable information for talent scouts and team managers. Additionally, we examine physical attributes and their relationship to player performance, revealing how factors like height, weight, and body type influence different aspects of the game.
